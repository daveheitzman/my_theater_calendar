Accessible WordPress event calendar plugin. Show events from multiple calendars on pages, in posts, or in widgets.

== Description ==

My Calendar provides basic event management and provides numerous methods to display your events. The plug-in can support individual calendars within WordPress Multi-User, or multiple calendars displaying different categories of events. 

Basic Features:

*	Standard calendar or list views of events in calendar
* 	Show events by week or by month
* 	Mini-calendar view for compact displays
*	Widget to show today's events
*	Configurable widget to show upcoming or past events 
*	Widget templating to control what information is displayed in widget output.
*	Calendar can be displayed including a single category, all categories, or a selection of categories
*	Disable default CSS and default JavaScript or display only on specific Pages/Posts
*	Editable CSS styles and JavaScript behaviors
* 	Events can be configured to be added by any level of user; directly to calendar or reserved for administrative approval
* 	Help information within the plugin for shortcode usage and widget templates.
* 	Store and display the following information for each event: title, description, alternate description, event category, URL, start date, start time, end date, end time, registration status (open, closed or irrelevant), event location.
* 	Email notification to administrator when events are scheduled or reserved
*	Location Manager for storing frequently used venues
*   	Import method from Kieran O'Shea's Calendar plugin
* 	Integrated Help file to guide in use of shortcodes and template tags

New:
*	Attach occurrences scheduled at arbitrary times to any event. 

This calendar branched from [Kieran O'Shea's Calendar plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/calendar/) in April 2010. You can import any previous scheduled events from Kieran's calendar into My Calendar.
